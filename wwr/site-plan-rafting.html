      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The website will convey the fun we can have on the river, times of year we run, sell the supplies people need, and promote river running as a whole. The entire family needs to be advertised as having fun and that it is a safe activity for all no matter if they are fit or handicapped. One day and two day trips will be the most advertised as well as week long trips will be advertised for the more adventurous individuals. The main message of our site will be: “Rafting is a fun activity for all to enjoy. Come and experience it for yourself and bring your family.”</p>
