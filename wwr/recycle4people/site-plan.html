    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      To help people to understand how they can sort and recycle the trash that they produce, and help them to find a
      place where they can recycle it. This site helps you to learn some basics principles which help you to start. Many
      people do not understand what they can do right now to help the planet. I’m going to try to solve this problem by
      using the website. This will help you develop some good habits that may not seem like much, but actually have a
      huge impact on the formation of a "green nation".
    </p> <!-- change this -->


    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>I would say that there are two categories of people for whom this site is created. The most numerous are those
      people who do not know anything about recycling, but would like to learn more. The other is those who already have
      an idea about this and want to enrich their knowledge, as well as find locations where they can take their garbage
      for recycling. </p> <!-- change this -->

    <p>
      Can you imagine how much unsorted garbage is collected per day in a house, neighborhood, city or world? The
      numbers will excite the minds of even the most creative dreamer. It is not necessary to immediately rush to
      extremes, buy 11 buckets and fanatically read the composition of each package. Start with something simple like
      paper or plastic bottles. Once it becomes a habit, it becomes easier to separate the rest.
      "I'm ready, what should I do?"
      • Deciding what type of raw material to start with. For example, from next week we will sort plastic bottles
      (except for opaque and oily ones).
      • We put a separate container in the apartment and do not forget to rinse and compress the bottle. This will help
      to avoid unpleasant odors and reduce the amount of debris.
      What can you collect right now?
      • Batteries
      • Lamps
      • Textiles and clothing

    <p>
      Plastic
      Sorting plastic is easy enough. Almost every package necessarily has a corresponding marking - a small triangle
      with a number. Therefore, we look at it and sort it. Before sorting, it is necessary to wash each plastic bottle
      or container, remove the film and stickers, if possible, crush to reduce the volume.
      Vegetable oil bottles, polystyrene foam and products with other markings are not accepted. Unfortunately, these
      types of waste will have to be sent to a regular trash can or unsorted waste container.

      Paper
      There is a general list of paper suitable for recycling. It can be found on the Internet or check at the reception
      point.
      To hand over waste paper, it is necessary to separate metal elements (springs, paper clips) and plastic elements
      (covers, files, folders). If possible, compress the paper to reduce the volume. Do not hand over paper in plastic
      bags, it is enough to tie a pile with a rope or put it in a box.

      Metal
      Almost any product can be handed over as a metal container: aluminum or tin cans, unpainted aluminum foil, can
      lids and small household scrap metal. Not everywhere accepts aerosol cans, foil and disposable baking containers.
      Before delivery, all containers must be freed from food debris, remove the lids, remove the labels and crumple the
      jars.

      Glass
      Bottles, jars and broken glass are considered glass containers. All this, too, must be cleaned of food residues
      and remove the covers. It is not necessary to remove the labels.
      Most likely, you will not accept light bulbs, ceramic and porcelain dishes, pan lids, optical or automotive glass,
      crystal. But it depends on the reception point, so you should check in advance

      Connect those around you

      1. Gather like-minded people
      First, tell your neighbors about your idea. Some may refuse, others will accept the idea with joy.
      Of course, you can set up separate waste collection in your home on your own, but the more residents, the easier
      it is. As a rule, when everything is ready and the system is adjusted, the rest are pulled up.

      2. We study the services of companies for the separate collection of waste
      Waste collection today is carried out by commercial organizations that independently export recyclable materials
      to processing plants. Try contacting these companies to inquire about services and rates. You can find them in
      several ways.
      • Search companies on the Internet for "buy/sell recyclables" and contact them.
      • Ask janitors and local stores. Most of the time they are aware.
      • Write to environmental movements and initiative groups in your city.
      • Contact local authorities.

    <h3>Lifehackes</h3>
    <p>
      What is made from recycled waste
      • Hangers, chairs, garbage bags, work clothes, shoes, fleece, covers for equipment, cars and finishing materials
      are made from old plastic.
      • Glass waste is used to make bottles, jars, glass and glass-ceramic tiles, water filtration compounds, smalt and
      mosaic glass.
      • Recycled metal is used to make cars, household appliances, sports equipment and even children's toys. At the
      same time, air pollution during production is reduced by 95%.


      Useful life hacks
      • Disposable cups and plastic bottles can be replaced with reusable mugs and thermoses.
      • Use shopping bags or cloth shopping bags. The package will no longer tear and will not have to be thrown away.
      • Instead of small disposable bags, mesh bags can be used. Vegetables and fruits can be weighed directly into
      them.
      • Avoid paper checks at ATMs whenever possible. They can be replaced with electronic ones, but, alas, they cannot
      be recycled.
      • Do not use a bag if you are buying items by weight by the piece. The price tag can be glued simply on the peel
      of a banana or pineapple.
      • Discard excess waste paper. Today, almost every store has an application or website where you can track
      promotions.
