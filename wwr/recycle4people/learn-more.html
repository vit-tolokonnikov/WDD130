                    <h3>Connect those around you</h3>
                    <p>1. Gather like-minded people
                        First, tell your neighbors about your idea. Some may refuse, others will accept the idea with
                        joy.
                        Of course, you can set up separate waste collection in your home on your own, but the more
                        residents, the easier
                        it is. As a rule, when everything is ready and the system is adjusted, the rest are pulled up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. We study the services of companies for the separate collection of waste
                        Waste collection today is carried out by commercial organizations that independently export
                        recyclable materials
                        to processing plants. Try contacting these companies to inquire about services and rates. You
                        can
                        find them in
                        several ways.
                    </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Search companies on the Internet for "buy/sell recyclables" and contact them.</li>
                            <li>Ask janitors and local stores. Most of the time they are aware.</li>
                            <li>Write to environmental movements and initiative groups in your city.</li>
                            <li>Contact local authorities.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>Plastic</h3>
                    <p>Sorting plastic is easy enough. Almost every package necessarily has a corresponding marking - a
                        small triangle
                        with a number. Therefore, we look at it and sort it. Before sorting, it is necessary to wash
                        each
                        plastic bottle
                        or container, remove the film and stickers, if possible, crush to reduce the volume.
                        Vegetable oil bottles, polystyrene foam and products with other markings are not accepted.
                        Unfortunately, these
                        types of waste will have to be sent to a regular trash can or unsorted waste container.</p>

                    <h3>Paper</h3>
                    <p>There is a general list of paper suitable for recycling. It can be found on the Internet or check
                        at
                        the reception
                        point.
                        To hand over waste paper, it is necessary to separate metal elements (springs, paper clips) and
                        plastic elements
                        (covers, files, folders). If possible, compress the paper to reduce the volume. Do not hand over
                        paper in plastic
                        bags, it is enough to tie a pile with a rope or put it in a box.</p>

                    <h3>Metal</h3>
                    <p>Almost any product can be handed over as a metal container: aluminum or tin cans, unpainted
                        aluminum
                        foil, can
                        lids and small household scrap metal. Not everywhere accepts aerosol cans, foil and disposable
                        baking containers.
                        Before delivery, all containers must be freed from food debris, remove the lids, remove the
                        labels
                        and crumple the
                        jars.</p>

                    <h3>Glass</h3>
                    <p>Bottles, jars and broken glass are considered glass containers. All this, too, must be cleaned of
                        food residues
                        and remove the covers. It is not necessary to remove the labels.
                        Most likely, you will not accept light bulbs, ceramic and porcelain dishes, pan lids, optical or
                        automotive glass,
                        crystal. But it depends on the reception point, so you should check in advance</p>
