                <h1>Rivers</h1>
                <p>Rivers are part of the hydrological cycle. Water generally collects in a river from precipitation
                    through a drainage basin from surface runoff and other sources such as groundwater recharge,
                    springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks.</p>

                    <p>Rivers and streams are often considered major features within a landscape; however, they actually
                        only cover around 0.1% of the land on Earth. They are made more obvious and significant to
                        humans since many human cities and civilizations are built around the freshwater supplied by
                        rivers and streams. Most of the major cities of the world are situated on the banks of
                        rivers, as they are, or were, used as a source of water, for obtaining food, for transport, as
                        borders, as a defensive measure, as a source of hydropower to drive machinery, for bathing, and
                        as a means of disposing of waste. In the preindustrial era larger rivers were a major
                        obstruction to the movement of people, goods, and armies across them. Towns often developed at
                        the few locations they could be crossed. Many major cities such as London are located at the
                        lowest point at which a river could be bridged.</p>

                    <p>Rivers can flow down mountains, through valleys (depressions) or along plains, and can create
                        canyons or gorges. The river channel typically contains a single stream of water, but some
                        rivers flow as several interconnecting streams of water, producing a braided river. Extensive
                        braided rivers are now found in only a few regions worldwide, such as the South
                        Island of New Zealand. They also occur on peneplains and some of the larger river deltas.
                        Anastamosing rivers are similar to braided rivers and are quite rare. They have multiple sinuous
                        channel - 1 carrying large volumes of sediment. There are rare cases of river bifurcation in
                        which a river divides and the resultant flows ending in different seas. An example is the
                        bifurcation of Nerodime River in Kosovo.</p>
